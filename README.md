# ProsperLoan Dataset Exploration


## Dataset

>  Prosper loan dataset.This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. In this analysis, I will focus on a few variables.
> The dataset is available on this link [ProsperLoan csv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv)

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that there was a strong positive relationship between Lender yield and Borrower APR.
 The distribution of BorrowerAPR and BorrowerRate are supposed to be similar with  slight difference since the APR is always higher
 than the interest rate.We notice that Current and completed loans have lower rate than the past-due loans and have lower mean
> We can see that there is a drop in 2009(maybe because of the crash) in loans but it started to increase gradually. Also employed 
people have lower IQR than not employed on the borrower APR.
